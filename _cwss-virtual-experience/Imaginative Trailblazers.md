<h1>Imaginative Trailblazers</h1>
<h3>Trailblazer Festival</h3>
<p>At CWSS, we take our play seriously and every year, we organise the trailblazer
festival where every student is involved in a maker activity. In 2018,
we all came together to make our own race car and even raced each other
in a friendly competition. This year, we took it up a notch by building
a chariot complete with a catapult to shoot at targets during the race.
Check out the adrenaline, screams and laughters at our Trailblazer Festivals!</p>

<h3>ECLAT 2.1 - An Aesthetics Showcase</h3>
<p>Eclat sets the stage for our Aesthetics and Performing Arts Champions
to showcase their various levels of creations. As Trailblazers, our students
start with sharing their own interpretation of an existing work of art
before they progress to the more advanced creation of their own work of
art from scratch. This year, due to the Safe Management Measures in place,
we were forced to move Eclat online but that definitely did not dampen
our Champions' creativity. Check out the first 4 Episodes of Eclat below!</p>
