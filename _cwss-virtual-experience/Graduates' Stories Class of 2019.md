Graduates' Stories - Class of 2019
==================================



There is no better way to learn about the CWSS Experience than to hear it from our graduates Farzana, Muneer and Edolphus who embody the spirit of Confident Learner, Imaginative Trailblazer and Compassionate Leader. They may have very different stories to tell about their time here in CWSS but the one common factor that these three heartwarming stories share is that they were all part of the COMMONWEALTH EXPERIENCE.
