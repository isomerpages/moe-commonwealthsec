COMPASSIONATE LEADERS
=====================

Commonwealth Secondary School believes that every child is unique and can grow to champion something worthy in the future. Anchored in our WEALTH values (Warmth, Enterprise, Adventurousness, Loyalty, Tenacity, Honour), every child is mentored by a Champion Mentor from Sec 1 to graduation, to be a Compassionate Leader. 

  

Through our comprehensive Education and Career Guidance, our Champion Mentors will help the students to discover their strengths and interests, guide them to identify a meaningful purpose that they would champion and inspire them to be the change that they want to see. By connecting to students’ goals and aspirations, their learning in school would be more meaningful and purposeful.
