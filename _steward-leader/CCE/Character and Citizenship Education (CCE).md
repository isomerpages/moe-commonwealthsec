<h1>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</h1>
<p>CCE is integrated into our instructional programmes, various co-curricular
programmes and key Student Development Experiences (SDEs). The design and
delivery of CCE lessons and programmes in CWSS are guided by the school’s
Character Framework, anchored on Steward Leadership. The 4 qualities of
Steward Leadership are mapped to the CCE Learning Outcomes and CWSS WEALTH
Values.</p>
<p>The school adopts the following guiding principles and approaches:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Every teacher a CCE teacher</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Teachers are best placed to lead and uphold the school’s WEALTH Values.
Teachers role-model values to shape and instil good character in students.
The quality of teacher-student relationships and the provision of a caring
and enabling environment are essential to the character development of
the students.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Values are both taught and caught</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Values are taught as knowledge and skills encapsulated in the CCE learning
outcomes. Values are caught when students witness values enacted by peers
and adults in different learning experiences.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Life experiences as a context for learning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The teaching and learning of CCE focus on using students’ as well as teachers’
life experiences to form the context for learning. This enables students
to better retain the knowledge, skills and values taught and caught.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Expanding domain from self to world</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students learn to embrace their social roles through interaction with
the world around them and act with consideration for the consequences of
their actions on themselves and others.</p>
<p>The school’s key CCE programmes include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Values-In-Action</em>, which is an important aspect of CCE in developing
vital 21st century skills and social-emotional competencies. CWSS works
closely with our long-term partners to provide opportunities for students
to contribute to the community and learn while contributing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Education and Career Guidance</em> (ECG) experiences helps students
to develop a sense of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and
self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth
mindset, adaptability and resilience to tackle challenges, embrace opportunities
and appreciate the value of various occupations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cohort Camps</em> provide students with immersive and experiential
learning opportunities to develop character traits of resilience and resourcefulness,
as well as social skills such as collaboration and communication. Each
cohort will go through different theme and experiences during their camp.</p>
