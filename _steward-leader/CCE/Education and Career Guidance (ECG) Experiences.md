<h2>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Experiences</h2>
<p>The comprehensive Commonwealth Education and Career Guidance (ECG) experiences
equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make
informed decisions at each key education stage. This enables successful
transitions to post-secondary school pathways and empowers students to
manage their career pathways and learn for life.</p>
<p>Our Champion Mentors, together with our ECG Counsellor, help students
to discover their strengths and interests, guide them to identify a meaningful
purpose that they would champion, and inspire them to be the change that
they want to see. By connecting with students’ goals and aspirations, their
learning in school would be more meaningful and purposeful.</p>
