<h1>Internationalisation Trips</h1>
<p>In Commonwealth Secondary School, we believe that it is important to learn
beyond the classroom. Our internationalisation trips create authentic learning
environments which provide opportunities for Commonwealthians to learn
and interact with people of different cultures. Through these trips, we
hope that Commonwealthians will grow in the WEALTH values as well as humanistic,
cultural and ethical values such as peace, friendship and collaboration.</p>

<p>Furthermore, learning by doing through field trips and school exchanges
provides students with opportunities to immerse themselves in a foreign
culture. It also gives them a chance to expand their understanding of global
affairs. This helps Commonwealthians to become develop self-confidence,
independence, greater self-esteem, and greater trust in their skills and
abilities. Commonwealthians will learn about the language, food, customs
of the country they visit. They will also learn how to build relationships
and find common ground with people who are different. In todayâ€™s globally
connected world, these are essential skills which a confident learner must
possess. No matter what the future holds for them, we are confident that
the experience of travelling and interacting with people around the world
will provide Commonwealthians with invaluable lessons that they will carry
with them for life.</p>
