Steward Leader
=====================

At Commonwealth Secondary School, our vision is for every child to grow to become a Steward Leader: a changemaker who champions a better future with the Community. In support of this vision, every child is mentored by a Champion Mentor, from Sec 1 to graduation, to be anchored in our WEALTH values (Warmth, Enterprise, Adventurousness, Loyalty, Tenacity, Honour)

We want our students to explore the concepts of stewardship: taking ownership; having a long-term view; being creatively resilient; and understanding our interdependence with one another. 

Ultimately, we want our students to become stewards of our community and shared future, with every generation endeavouring to pass on an even better world to the next generation.
