<p>At CWSS, we offer a diverse range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) to
support the holistic development of our students. Our CCA programme is
designed to nurture character, cultivate leadership, and build social-emotional
skills while fostering a strong sense of belonging and teamwork.</p>
<p>Our Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) empower students to serve, grow and
lead through the school experience. Students are given platforms to:
<br><strong>Represent the school</strong>
<br>Showcase their talents at national platforms such as the&nbsp;National
School Games,&nbsp;Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentations, and various
competitions and exhibitions.
<br><strong>Serve the Community</strong>
<br>Participate in Values-in-Action (VIA) projects that are integrated into
CCAs, fostering empathy and civic responsibility.
<br><strong>Develop Interpersonal Competencies</strong>
<br>Engage in team-based activities that promote collaboration, communication,
and lasting friendships.
<br><strong>Explore Interests and Aspirations </strong>
<br>Explore strengths and interests, discover new talent, build a strong foundation
of knowledge and skills, and grow into confident, passionate learners.
<br><strong>Gain Real-World Experience</strong>
<br>Learn in authentic settings through hands-on activities and on-the-job
training that connect classroom learning to real-life applications.
<br><strong>Lead with Purpose</strong>
<br>Take on leadership roles within their CCAs to develop confidence, initiative,
and a sense of personal mastery.
<br><strong>Reflect and Grow</strong>
<br>Reflect meaningfully on their experiences and articulate the values theyâ€™ve
learned, fostering self-awareness and personal growth.
