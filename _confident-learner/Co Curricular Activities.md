<p>The school continually reviews and refines its CCA programme to ensure
that students are engaged and supported as they pursue their interests.
The school also emphasises team or group-based CCA activities to ensure
that students develop strong inter-personal skills, and forge lasting friendships
their CCA activities.</p>

apply and excel in their CCAs:-</p>

<br><strong>A</strong>&nbsp;– Aspiration-Base
<br><strong>M</strong>&nbsp;– Mastery of Learning
<br><strong>P</strong>&nbsp;– Progress
<br><strong>S</strong>&nbsp;– Stars</p>
