Academic Programmes
===================

We nurture Confident Learners with a Growth Mindset and the 5 Minds (Disciplined, Synthesising, Creating, Respectful, Ethical) for the future. We are a thriving community for innovation, discovery, expression and accomplishment, where our students can push boundaries to improve, be open to explore new ideas, communicate their thoughts effectively and acquire the ability to self-assess and self-regulate their learning.

**Personalised Digital Learning Programme**<br> 
In order for Commonwealthians to be confident learners and imaginative trailblazers with 21st century competencies, our students must be skillful at using the latest technology to enhance their learning anytime, anywhere, responsibly. 

At Commonwealth, students bring their own Personal Learning Device (PLD) to school. They will use the devices to activate their learning by accessing varied digital resources, to think critically via data analysis and collaborative discussion, to demonstrate learning through quizzes, creation of digital products and presentation, as well as to receive timely and customised feedback from teachers and peers.

More details on the technical specifications of PLD (eg: Windows laptop/tablet with stylus input) and funding (eg Edusave Pupil Fund and subsidies) will be provided during the Secondary 1 orientation briefing for parents.
