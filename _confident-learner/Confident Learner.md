CONFIDENT LEARNER
=================

We nurture Confident Learners with a Growth Mindset and the 5 Minds (Disciplined, Synthesising, Creating, Respectful, Ethical) for the future. We are a thriving community for innovation, discovery, expression and accomplishment, where our students can push boundaries to create new ideas, products and services, discover the truth via inquiry, experiential and collaborative learning, communicate their thoughts confidently, and accomplish through practice and self-reflection.
