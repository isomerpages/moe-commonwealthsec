<h4>English Language&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ELL Department’s English Language Programme prepares our students
for the G1, G2 and G3 English Language at the Singapore-Cambridge Secondary
Education Certificate (SEC) examination.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bridging Programmes are conducted at the end of each academic year to
provide learning support for students taking up English Language at a More
Demanding Level – G1 to G2, and G2 to G3.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Balanced with the rigour of language learning in the English classroom,
critical thinking skills, adaptive thinking and collaborative learning
take place in multimodal lesson activities, gamification, and alternative
assessments.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Joy of Learning and 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies are also nurtured
through the Learning Journeys for cohort-level experiences at local theatrical
productions and visits to places of interest to explore the use of language
in the intersections with art, culture, and heritage.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Literature in English&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Commonwealthians undergo the Lower Secondary Literature in English programme
in Secondary 1 and 2 at the G2 and G3 levels. The programme exposes students
to Poetry, Prose, and Drama over the span of 2 years, which enriches their
language learning with an appreciation for the literary arts in English
Language.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The ELL Department also offers Literature in English at the Upper Secondary
level for those who demonstrate keen interest in the subject. These G2
and G3 Literature in English subjects are then examinable at the SEC examinations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning of Literature is brought alive from the print texts by experiential
activities such as Reader’s Theatre, Poetry Recitals, and Learning Journeys
to experience how theatrical productions translate dramatic scripts into
stage magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Talent Development Programme&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ELL Department Talent Development Programme is designed in a two-pronged
approach – the literacy component in the Wordsmiths activities, and the
oracy component in the Voxsmiths activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Wordsmiths workshops are for students who are passionate in creating
poetry and prose, while the Voxsmiths workshops are for students who find
that they enjoy sharing their ideas with others through the spoken word.
These workshops are usually conducted under the ambit of CWSS’ Trailblazer
Thursday workshops, where students are free to sign up for the multitude
of workshops to learn something new and outside the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Talents in the literacy and oracy domains are from their exposure training
at the workshops and are given opportunities for more advanced training
through in-house workshops, experiential learning journeys and participation
in competitions to enhance and develop their craft.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students in the Wordsmiths workshops are encouraged to develop their portfolio
for suitable writing competitions and for submission to the MOE Gifted
Branch’s Creative Arts Programme Seminar. They also take part in the National
Schools’ Literature Festival’s Flash Fiction competition and other competitions
during Poetry Festival Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Oratorical talents encouraged to broaden their experience through the
various training platforms such as being emcees at school events, and work
towards participation in the Orator’s Trophy,&nbsp;National Schools’ Literature
Festival’s Debate competitions and the Plain English Speaking Award (PESA).&nbsp;</p>
