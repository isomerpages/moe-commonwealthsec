<h3><strong>English Language &amp; Literature</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our ELL teachers aim to nurture students to be passionate and confident
explorers of the language and literature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CWSS ELL Curriculum is designed to offer students opportunities to
cultivate mastery of language and literature through experiential learning
opportunities as well as platforms for students to broaden their perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of these opportunities include Drama-in-Curriculum, Reading-in-Curriculum,
Poetry Trails, Learning Journeys to musicals, plays, and museums and engaging
project tasks such as the creation of podcasts, vlogs, and mini drama production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To inculcate a love for reading, we have a “Book Club” student interest
group which is guided by members of the ELL Department and the Librarian.</p>

<h4>English Language&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ELL Department’s English Language Programme prepares our students
for the G1, G2 or G3 Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate
(SEC) English Language examination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridging Programmes are conducted at the end of each academic year to
provide learning support for students taking up English Language at a More
Demanding Level, i.e., G1 to G2, or G2 to G3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students develop critical thinking, adaptive thinking and collaborative
learning skills through rigorous multimodal lesson activities, gamification,
and alternative assessments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Joy of Learning and 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies are also nurtured
through the Learning Journeys for cohort-level experiences at local theatrical
productions and visits to places of interest to explore the use of language
in the intersections with art, culture, and heritage.</p>
</li>

<h4>Literature in English&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Commonwealthians undergo the Lower Secondary Literature in English programme
in Secondary 1 and 2 at the G2 or G3 levels. The programme exposes students
to Poetry, Prose, and Drama over the span of 2 years, which enriches their
language learning with an appreciation for the literary arts in English
Language.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The ELL Department also offers G3 or G2 Literature in English at the Upper
Secondary level for those who demonstrate keen interest in the subject.
Interested and eligible students can select this subject as an examinable
elective subject for the SEC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The learning of Literature is brought alive from the print texts by experiential
activities such as Reader’s Theatre, Poetry Recitals, and Learning Journeys
to experience how theatrical productions translate dramatic scripts into
stage magic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Talent Development Programme&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ELL Department’s Talent Development Programme is designed in a two-pronged
approach: the literacy component in Wordsmiths activities, and the oracy
component in the Voxsmiths activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wordsmiths workshops are for students who are passionate in creating poetry
and prose while Voxsmiths workshops are for students who enjoy sharing
their ideas with others through the spoken word. These workshops are usually
conducted under the ambit of CWSS’ Trailblazer Thursday workshops, where
students are free to sign up for the multitude of workshops to learn to
create something new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talents in the literacy and oracy domains can further develop their creative
competencies through in-house workshops, experiential learning journeys
and participation in competitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students in the Wordsmiths workshops are encouraged to develop their portfolio
for suitable writing competitions and for submission at the Ministry of
Education’s Creative Arts Programme Seminar. They also take part in the
National Schools’ Literature Festival’s Flash Fiction competition and other
competitions during Poetry Festival Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oratorical talents are encouraged to broaden their experience through
various training platforms such as being emcees at school events, and work
towards participation in the Orator’s Trophy,&nbsp; National Schools’ Literature
Festival’s Debate competitions and the Plain English Speaking Award (PESA).</p>
