<h3><strong>Craft &amp; Technology</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Design &amp; Technology</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bringing Ideas to Life through Design and Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our D&amp;T curriculum offers students a thoughtfully-designed blend of
hands-on and minds-on experiences. We aim to nurture confident, imaginative
learners who find joy in creating, problem-solving, and appreciating how
design shapes everyday life.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Secondary: Laying the Foundations</strong>
</p>
<p>In lower secondary, students are introduced to the exciting world of design
through fun and practical design-and-make tasks. They learn to explore
real-world problems, sketch and communicate ideas — both on paper and using <strong>digital sketching tools</strong>.
In the workshop, they gain confidence working with a variety of tools and
materials, building both creativity and technical skills. Students also
begin using digital platforms like <strong>Onshape</strong>, a cloud-based
3D CAD software, to visualize and develop their ideas in a virtual environment.</p>

<p><strong>Upper Secondary: Deepening Skills with Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>At the upper secondary level, students take on more complex design challenges
through coursework. They apply a structured design process to identify
user needs, conduct research, generate ideas, and develop functional prototypes.</p>
<p>The curriculum continues to evolve with the advancement of technology,
including the growing relevance of tools such as <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>,
which are increasingly recognized for their potential to support ideation
and development.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, students learn to manage project timelines, document
their thinking, and reflect critically on their outcomes—developing independence,
resilience, and real-world problem-solving skills.</p>
<p><strong>With every challenge and creation, </strong>the D&amp;T curriculum
nurtures critical, inventive, and adaptive thinking—shaping confident problem-solvers
for a fast-changing, technology-driven world.</p>

<h4><strong>Art</strong></h4>
<p>Our Art Programme offers a rich blend of <strong>visual art, art theory, art history, and art critique</strong>.
Rooted in a project-based approach, students explore, experiment, and create
across a wide range of traditional and digital media while developing both <strong>technical skills</strong> and <strong>personal expression</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>1. Learning Through Technology and AI</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>AI and EdTech</strong> are central to our lessons, reshaping how
students ideate, create, and critique. Students use AI not just as a creative
tool, but to expand their conceptual thinking and digital fluency in an
evolving artistic landscape.</p>

<p><strong>2. Making Thinking Visible with Drawing</strong>
</p>
<p>Drawing — both <strong>analogue and digital</strong> — is used to visualise
thought processes, support ideation, and develop creative clarity. It encourages
problem-solving, experimentation, and communication through visual language.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Learning with Portfolio</strong>
</p>
<p>Students <strong>document, curate, reflect, and (re)present</strong> their
learning journeys through portfolios. This process builds critical thinking,
artistic ownership, and readiness for further studies in the arts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Programme Outcomes</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop artistic skills and a personal
voice</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain confidence through exploration
and reflection</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appreciate art’s role in society,
past and present</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build visual and critical literacy
for the future</p>
<h4><strong>Music</strong></h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary Music Curriculum aims to equip students with the skills
to express themselves confidently through music creation and performance.
It is designed around the three key Musical Processes: Listening, Creating,
and Performing. Through these, students explore music from multiple perspectives—as
performers, composers, and audience members—building musical understanding
that is both personal and purposeful.</p>
<p>In Lower Secondary, students develop their musical skills progressively.
In Secondary One, they learn to play the ukulele, focusing on instrumental
techniques and ensemble playing. They also use BandLab, a digital music
production tool, to create immersive soundscapes and experiment with music
technology. In Secondary Two, students transition to learning the keyboard
while exploring the connection between music and film by composing original
soundtracks using Mixcraft software. Throughout the two years, students
are exposed to a variety of musical genres and cultures, encouraging them
to appreciate diverse musical styles. These experiences foster creativity,
teamwork, and self-expression, while helping students build confidence
and see how music relates to real-world contexts.</p>
<p>To deepen their musical experience, students are also given opportunities
to attend live performances and musicals, such as <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>.
These curated concert experiences aim to broaden their exposure to the
performing arts and connect classroom learning with authentic musical encounters. <em>(Note: Participation in some of these activities may be offered only to selected groups of students.)</em>
</p>
<p>At the Upper Secondary level, we offer G1 Music, where students develop
practical music skills through instrument learning, music creation, and
performance. They build foundational knowledge in musical elements, explore
different genres, and engage in hands-on music-making that encourages creativity
and self-expression.</p>

<p>As part of the G1 Music experience, students take part in an end-of-year
performance at ITE, showcasing what they have learned in a real concert
setting. They are also brought on a learning journey to a professional
music recording studio, where they get a chance to record a piece of music.
These authentic experiences not only deepen their musical learning but
also build confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment.</p>
