<h3><strong>Physical Education</strong></h3>
<p>At Commonwealth Secondary School, our PE Department is all about inspiring
students to become confident, resilient, and passionate about staying active-
for life! Our curriculum is designed to Engage, Enthuse, and Equip students
with the skills, values, and knowledge they need to thrive both in and
beyond school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe in student-centred learning: where every studentâ€™s ability,
interest and learning style is valued. Through experiential learning and
differentiated instruction, we cater to diverse abilities and interests.
During the teaching of games, we adopt the Game-Based Learning approach
where students learn through play- developing skills, tactics, and strategies
in various game scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our Syllabus</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Games Module: Students explore a wide range of games like Handball, Volleyball,
Floorball, and Softball over 4 to 5 years in CWSS. This culminates into
the highly anticipated Inter-Class competitions held at the end of the
year for our Secondary 1-3 students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outdoor Education: Students also learn essential life skills such as campcraft,
outdoor cooking, first aid and environmental awareness while learning to
care for the community and stay safe outdoors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Physical, Health and Fitness: From learning the basics on anatomy, nutrition
and ultimately planning their own fitness program, students are empowered
to progressively take ownership of their physical well-being and fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Classroom</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PE programme does not stop at the gym or the field! We offer exciting
and meaningful experiences that are designed to build character and lasting
memories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
