<h3><strong>Physical Education</strong></h3>
<p>At Commonwealth Secondary School, PE is about inspiring students to become
confident, resilient, and passionate about staying active—for life! Our
curriculum is designed to Engage, Enthuse, and Equip students with the
values, skills, and knowledge they need to thrive in and beyond school.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe in student-centred learning where every student’s ability,
interest and learning style is valued. Through experiential learning and
differentiated instruction, we cater to diverse abilities and interests.
During the teaching of games, we adopt the Game-Based Learning approach
where students learn through play and develop skills, tactics, and strategies
in various game scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Our Syllabus</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Games Module: Students explore a wide range of games such as Handball,
Volleyball, Floorball, and Softball over 4 to 5 years in CWSS. This culminates
in the highly anticipated Inter-Class competitions held at the end of the
year for our Secondary 1-3 students.</p>
<p>Outdoor Education: Students also learn essential life skills such as campcraft,
outdoor cooking, first aid and environmental awareness while learning to
care for the community and stay safe outdoors.</p>
<p>Physical, Health and Fitness: From learning the basics about anatomy and
nutrition to ultimately planning their own fitness program, students are
empowered to progressively take ownership of their physical well-being
and fitness.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Classroom</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PE programme does not stop at the gym or the field. We offer exciting
and meaningful experiences that are designed to build character and lasting
memories:</p>
