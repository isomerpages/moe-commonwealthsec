<h3><strong>Mathematics &amp; Computing</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mathematics</strong></h4>
<p>Our teachers aim to develop students to be creative and metacognitive
problem solvers through our Mathematics curriculum. To build confidence
in&nbsp;Math, students are given opportunities to communicate their thinking
process during lessons. Students learn to make connections between concepts
across topics and strengthen mathematical processes through Inquiry-based
learning and collaboratively solving real-world Math applications. &nbsp;Students
to develop understanding of Math concepts through technology using simulation,
digital manipulatives, and Graphing tools.</p>

<h4><strong>Computing</strong></h4>
<p>Computing is offered to our students as an upper secondary elective subject.
It develops computational thinking, problem analysis and evaluation, effective
problem-solving, and systems thinking. Through the study of this subject,
students think algorithmically, plan and design of steps to solve tasks,
appreciate the legal, ethical and security issues relating to the use of
computers, gain understanding of emerging technologies and the impact of
technology on society, and develop 21st century competencies to address
the global challenges of an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world.</p>
<h4><u>Mathematics Talent Development Programme</u></h4>
<p>Our Math Talent Development Programme (TDP) nurtures students who have
passion and talent in Mathematics and guides them to become creative problem-solvers.
TDP students participate in Singapore Mathematical Olympiad training and
interest groups in specialised areas, namely Data Analytics, Mathematical
Modelling and Maths Ambassadors. Through these activities, students gain
opportunities to deepen their understanding of Math, sharpen critical thinking
skills, and explore diverse mathematical concepts. Our TDP inspires Commonwealthians
to pursue their interest in Maths and also builds a community of young
thinkers who are prepared to tackle complex problems with confidence and
creativity. Our students participate in competitions such as the Singapore
Mathematical Olympiad, the Singapore Mathematical and Computational Modelling
Challenge, the International Mathematical Modelling Challenge and the NUS
Statistical Poster Competition.</p>
