<p>The Humanities Department adopts an Inquiry-Based Learning approach to
spark curiosity and nurture self-directed learners with strong critical
and analytical thinking skills. &nbsp;Through the curriculum, we seek to
develop confident and thoughtful Commonwealthians who can critically examine
diverse perspectives, communicate with empathy, collaborate effectively,
and take action ethically in an increasingly interconnected and globalised
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the curriculum, Commonwealthians engage in experiential learning
through activities such as History Investigation projects, Geographical
Investigation fieldwork, and learning journeys to sites of historical and
geographical significance, where they apply inquiry skills to better understand
real-world issues. Within our Elements of Business Skills (EBS) subject,
students build foundational business knowledge and practical skills that
equip them to navigate the future of work with confidence, adaptability,
and purpose.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Enrichment Activities</strong></h3>
<p>As part of our Trailblazer Thursday programme, Commonwealthians engage
in creative and thought-provoking enrichment activities that bring learning
to life. One such activity is the Wartime Kitchen, where students combine
historical empathy with creativity to research and recreate food items
from wartime Singapore. These hands-on experiences deepen studentsâ€™ understanding
and allow them to meaningfully connect with the Humanities curriculum through
research and experiential learning.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Humanities Talent Development</strong></h3>
<p>Commonwealthians who demonstrate passion and potential in the Humanities
can take part in the Humanities Talent Development Programme, which provides
authentic platforms for exploration and growth. Through this programme,
students are given opportunities to deepen their interests and sharpen
their abilities in real-world contexts.</p>
<p>The programmes include participation in Model United Nations (MUN) conferences,
where they engage in diplomacy and debate on global issues, and the National
University of Singapore (NUS) Geography Challenge, where they tackle complex
geographical problems through critical thinking and creative solutions.
Such experiences aim to engage, empower, and educate our students, nurturing
them as thoughtful young thinkers and active global citizens.</p>
