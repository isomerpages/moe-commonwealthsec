<p>Commonwealth Secondary School adopted Maker Education since 2014. Over
the years, it has expanded into the TrailBlazer Programme where students
have the freedom to choose any types of purposeful making and creation.
All Commonwealthians are encouraged to take part in TrailBalzer Programme
through the following ways:</p>

</ul>
<p>From July 2021, Thursday afternoons are TrailBlazer Space time for all
Commonwealthians. During TrailBlazer Space time, students can either take
part in TrailBlazer Workshops of their interest or work on their self-initiated
projects, at various places such as D.space (Maker space), Cordon Bleu
(Kitchen), Imaginarium (Library), Sandbox (Computer labs), Louvre (Art
room), Design Loft, or even at home as part of Blended Learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through TrailBlazer Programme, all students can be recognized for the
values of adventurousness and enterprise they demonstrate.&nbsp; Their
creations will be celebrated, they can build their creativity portfolio,
and they will also have the opportunity to participate in various exhibitions
and competitions. They are recognised in Trailblazer attainment levels:</p>
