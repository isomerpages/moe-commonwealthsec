<p>In Design Thinking, students learn to be human-centred problem solvers.
They identify complex challenges, understand the needs of those around
them, and then work in teams to prototype and test innovative solutions
that meet those needs.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Design Thinking Process</strong></h4>
<p><u>Empathise_</u>
<br>As human-centered designers, students need to understand the people for
whom they are designing. Students learn to build empathy for who they are
and what is important to them.</p>
<p><u>Define_</u>
<br>Based on a deep understanding of the people they are designing for, students
learn to generate a meaningful challenge – a problem statement from the
designer’s point of view.</p>
<p><u>Ideate_</u>
<br>At this stage of the process, students focus on idea generation, coming
up with a large number of varied ideas, including wild and unusual ideas.</p>
<p><u>Prototype and Test_</u>
<br>Students learn to create prototypes, a physical object that people can
interact with and experience for testing and feedback-gathering. These
interactions drive deeper empathy and the iterations help shape successful
solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the process of solving these problems, students learn empathy, collaborative
skills and the value of radical ideas. The following Design Thinking Mindsets
are developed:</p>
<p><u>Human-Centred_</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Students exercise empathy for the users they are designing for, and gather
feedback from these users. This is fundamental for good design.</p>
<p><u>Radical Collaboration_</u>
<br>Students work in mixed groups and leverage on different viewpoints to
generate creative ideas and realise their design.</p>
<p><u>Mindful of Process_</u>
<br>Students know where they are in the design process at any time, what methods
to use in that stage, and what their goals are.</p>
<p><u>Embrace experimentation_</u>
<br>Students build as a way to think and learn.</p>
<p><u>Bias Toward Action_</u>
<br>Students learn to do and make, rather than just think and meet.</p>
<h4><strong>Design Thinking Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The CWSS Design Thinking Curriculum is taught as a spiral progression
from Secondary One to Three.</p>
<p><u>Secondary One:</u>&nbsp;Students experience mindset-building sessions
and short design sprints to introduce them to design thinking.</p>
<p><u>Secondary Two:</u>&nbsp;Students take on a more rigorous design challenge
which will deepen their learning and through their application of the design
thinking mindsets and skills. The challenge requires students to address
a need in the school or community.</p>
<p><u>Secondary Three:</u>&nbsp;Students initiate their own design challenges
with their CCAs as they work together to plan for their Values-In-Action
(VIA) Projects using the Design Thinking approach.</p>
<h4><strong>Design Thinking for School Improvement</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to being a key programme for students, staff the school also
employs the design thinking approach to drive innovation and continuous
improvement.</p>
<p>The school has applied design thinking in the following areas:</p>
<p>• Developing innovative spaces including the Imaginarium (school library),
the D.space (school makerspace), the Asgard (school canteen)</p>
<p>• Transforming school programmes and events, including the lower secondary
science Farm-to-Table programme, the &nbsp;TrailBlazer Festivals and the
annual Open House&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Streamlining school work processes, including data management, administrative
workflows</p>
