<p><strong><u>School’s Arts Education Policy</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school's arts education policy is premised on the school’s Total Curriculum
Framework of Creativity, Character and Content, and student outcomes. The
C3 Framework addresses the school’s vision, mission and values. The Creativity
Curriculum Framework specifically sets the direction for aesthetic programmes.
Aesthetics units and committees craft out programmes and build in specific
characteristics based on the Creativity Curriculum Framework.</p>
<p>Aesthetic programmes were crafted based on the following from the Creativity
Curriculum Framework</p>

</div>
<p>To help us realise the Creativity Curriculum Framework, we adopt a “3A”
approach in the conduct of the Aesthetic Programme via Appreciation, Attainment
and Ambassadorship.</p>
<p>1. <u>Appreciation:</u>
</p>
<p>Provide each and every student with the opportunity to appreciate the
arts through arts exposure and experience, such as performing arts assembly
programmes, Music, Art and Drama curriculum, attending professional performances,
special interest group outings. At this level, students are given the opportunity
to be exposed to different art forms, hence widen their existing knowledge
in arts.</p>
<p>2. <u>Attainment:</u>
</p>
<p>Develop talented students to their fullest by igniting passion and inspiring
excellence. Talented students in the performing arts CCAs are given opportunities
to hone their skills through instruction by well-renowned coaches, local
and international workshops and master classes. For students who are not
in the performing arts CCAs but display talents and interests in the aesthetics,
interest groups are formed to further develop their skills to the fullest.</p>
<p>3. <u>Ambassadorship:</u>
</p>
<p>Illuminate new frontiers by contributing to the community as ambassadors
for the arts. Students from performing arts CCAs and interest groups frequently
showcase their talents at various performing platforms such as major school
events, school concerts and to the community.</p>
<p>The school’s long-term goals for arts education are as follows:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To allow our students to be passionate learners
and imaginative trailblazers through structures and systems put in place
to promote Arts Education</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To engage students and staff in aesthetics
so as to build a community of learners in realising.</p>
<p>The school’s short-term arts education goals are as follows:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To develop students in the understanding
and the application of the skills learnt through the Art Instructional
Programmes, performing arts CCAs as well as the arts enrichment programmes,
from personal achievements to achievements obtained at the school level.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To ensure succession in aesthetic interests
and skills from the older batch of students to the younger batches, so
as to be ambassadors of the art forms they represent.</p>
<p>A structured and consistent approach was adopted to ensure all students
were involved in aesthetic exposures at different levels. This is achieved
through a few different areas: &nbsp;school-wide programmes, art instructional
curriculum, aesthetic CCAs and enrichment programmes in art forms such
as music, art, drama, dance, digital and visual art.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CCAs</strong>
<br>Commonwealth Secondary School is well-known for our niche in Performing
Arts CCAs. The various CCAs include&nbsp;<strong>Band, Chinese Dance, Choir, Drama, Indian Dance, Malay Dance</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Urban Nature</strong>,
our very own percussion group. Majority of these CCAs have consistently
attained top honours at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging
since 2001. In the recent SYF Central Judging held in 2019, the school
has attained four distinction awards, one commendation and one accomplishment
award.</p>

<p><strong>Non-CCA Exposure</strong>

part of the lower secondary curriculum. Furthermore, various platform to
expose students with performing arts includes aesthetic audition for all
secondary-1, morning assembly, enrichment programme, CWSS Recess Time Concert,
post-examination activities and attending external performances.</p>
<p>In addition, non-performing art students were given opportunities to participate
in the audition for Teacher's Day Celebration Concert, Talent Showcase
and newly implemented CWSS Recess Time Concert, which provided them opportunities
to perform at various platforms. Selected students were given the opportunities
to train under professional trainers or teachers and put up a performance
in the various concerts mentioned.</p>
