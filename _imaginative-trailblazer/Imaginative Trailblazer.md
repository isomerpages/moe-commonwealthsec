<p>Commonwealth Secondary School adopted Maker Education since 2014. Over
the years, it has expanded into the TrailBlazer Programme where students
have the freedom to choose any types of purposeful making and creation.
All Commonwealthians are encouraged to take part in TrailBalzer Programme
through the following ways:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>TrailBlazer Workshops offered by school</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Every week, a wide range of making/creating workshops are offered for
students to sign up. There are different types of making to cater to the
diverse interests and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talents
of our students. This includes</p>
<p>o STEM-based making
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Digital Maker
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Aesthetics Maker (Dance, Music, Video, Production
&amp; Hosting etc.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Arteastiq and Master Art Class (Art Maker)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Tinkering Kitchen (Food Maker)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Wordsmiths (Creative Writing)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Special workshops offered by fellow Commonealthians</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Self-Initiated Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to initiate their own making/creating
projects beyond what are offered by school. To start a self-initiated project,
students can</p>
<p>o Extend from what they learn from school-offered TrailBlazer Workshops
(supported by TrailBlazer teachers)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Take up an extension topic of an academic subject
and create a product to deepen learning (supported by Academic Programme
Departments)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Take up a design challenge and create a solution
to improve others’ life (supported by Design Thinking teachers)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;o Pursue own interest and passion to make any type
of purposeful creations</p>
<p>From July 2021, Thursday afternoons are TrailBlazer Space time for all
Commonwealthians. During TrailBlazer Space time, students can either take
part in TrailBlazer Workshops of their interest or work on their self-initiated
projects, at various places such as D.space (Maker space), Cordon Bleu
(Kitchen), Imaginarium (Library), Sandbox (Computer labs), Louvre (Art
room), Design Loft, or even at home as part of Blended Learning.</p>
<p>Through TrailBlazer Programme, all students can be recognized for the
values of adventurousness and enterprise they demonstrate.&nbsp; Their
creations will be celebrated, they can build their creativity portfolio,
and they will also have the opportunity to participate in various exhibitions
and competitions.</p>
