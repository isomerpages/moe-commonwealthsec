<h4><strong>Community</strong></h4>
<p>Commonwealth Secondary School extends its eco-stewardship efforts into
the wider community through meaningful outreach and partnerships. Our Farm-to-Table
Programme provides students with hands-on experience in sustainable agriculture
through hydroponics and vertical farming. Harvested crops are used in the
school canteen, while surplus produce is donated to eldercare centres and
community food programmes in the neighbourhood. To sustain and strengthen
our efforts, we collaborate with community gardeners to exchange knowledge
and refine our urban farming techniques.</p>
<p>To celebrate and share our rich biodiversity, students and staff actively
document wildlife sightings on campus, contributing over 2,300 posts on
Instagram using the hashtag #cwssbiodiversity. These sightings are also
featured in our termly Biodiversity Newsletter, a resource shared with
the school community and visiting educators who attend biodiversity-related
workshops and guided tours.</p>
<p>Our Eco Club members serve as environmental ambassadors, conducting biodiversity
audits and leading guided tours for both local and international visitors,
sharing our journey and inspiring others to take action for a more sustainable
future.</p>
