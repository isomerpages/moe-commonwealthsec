<h4><strong>DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bringing Ideas to Life through Design and Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our D&amp;T curriculum offers students a thoughtfully-designed blend of
hands-on and minds-on experiences. We aim to nurture confident, imaginative
learners who find joy in creating, problem-solving, and appreciating how
design shapes everyday life.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Secondary: Laying the Foundations</strong>
</p>
<p>In lower secondary, students are introduced to the exciting world of design
through fun and practical design-and-make tasks. They learn to explore
real-world problems, sketch and communicate ideas — both on paper and using <strong>digital sketching tools</strong>.
In the workshop, they gain confidence working with a variety of tools and
materials, building both creativity and technical skills. Students also
begin using digital platforms like <strong>Onshape</strong>, a cloud-based
3D CAD software, to visualize and develop their ideas in a virtual environment.</p>

<p><strong>Upper Secondary: Deepening Skills with Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>At the upper secondary level, students take on more complex design challenges
through coursework. They apply a structured design process to identify
user needs, conduct research, generate ideas, and develop functional prototypes.</p>
<p>The curriculum continues to evolve with the advancement of technology,
including the growing relevance of tools such as <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>,
which are increasingly recognized for their potential to support ideation
and development.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, students learn to manage project timelines, document
their thinking, and reflect critically on their outcomes—developing independence,
resilience, and real-world problem-solving skills.</p>
<p><strong>With every challenge and creation, </strong>the D&amp;T curriculum
nurtures critical, inventive, and adaptive thinking—shaping confident problem-solvers
for a fast-changing, technology-driven world.</p>

<h4><strong>ART</strong></h4>
<p>Our Art Programme offers a rich blend of <strong>visual art, art theory, art history, and art critique</strong>.
Rooted in a project-based approach, students explore, experiment, and create
across a wide range of traditional and digital media while developing both <strong>technical skills</strong> and <strong>personal expression</strong>.</p>
