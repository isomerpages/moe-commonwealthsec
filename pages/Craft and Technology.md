<h4><strong>DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bringing Ideas to Life through Design and Technology (D&amp;T)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our D&amp;T curriculum offers students a thoughtfully-designed blend of
hands-on and minds-on experiences. We aim to nurture confident, imaginative
learners who find joy in creating, problem-solving, and appreciating how
design shapes everyday life.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Secondary: Laying the Foundations</strong>
</p>
<p>In lower secondary, students are introduced to the exciting world of design
through fun and practical design-and-make tasks. They learn to explore
real-world problems, sketch and communicate ideas â€” both on paper and using <strong>digital sketching tools</strong>.
In the workshop, they gain confidence working with a variety of tools and
materials, building both creativity and technical skills. Students also
begin using digital platforms like <strong>Onshape</strong>, a cloud-based
3D CAD software, to visualize and develop their ideas in a virtual environment.</p>
