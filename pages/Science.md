<p>The Science Department at Commonwealth Secondary School nurtures Commonwealthians
who are <strong>'Inspired by Science'</strong>, <strong>'Inquire like Scientists'</strong>,
and <strong>'Innovate Using Science'</strong>. We believe that every student
can appreciate Science and learn to use it to improve life.</p>
<h3><strong>Inspiring Commonwealthians Through STEM</strong></h3>
<p>We ignite curiosity through hands-on STEM Maker activities integrated
throughout our curriculum. Students &nbsp;apply concepts learnt in Science
to design and construct Solar Cookers Chemical Reaction Powered boats,
detailed DNA and lung models, and other artefacts. These activities make
abstract concepts tangible and memorable demonstrate that Science is not
just a subject to study, but a source of endless inspiration and creativity.</p>
<h3><strong>Developing Scientific Inquiry</strong></h3>
<p>Our <strong>Farm-to-Table Programme</strong> nurtures all Secondary 1 and
2 Commonwealthians as young researchers. Secondary 1 students explore plant
growth using outdoor hydroponics units, investigating how different variables
affect development through hands-on experimentation.</p>
<p>Secondary 2 students study indoor hydroponics systems to discover how
technology can revolutionize agriculture and increase crop yields. Students
harvest their vegetables and prepare them in our adjacent Food and Consumer
Education (FCE) Room, applying what they have learnt in FCE lessons as
they literally taste the fruits of their labour.</p>
<p>These activities support Singapore's goal of producing 30% of our food
supply locally by 2030, by helping Commonwealthians understand how science
addresses real-world challenges and improves daily life.</p>

<h3><strong>Nurturing Scientific Talent</strong></h3>
<p>We take learning beyond classroom walls so that Commonwealthians can observe
Science in action. Every year, Secondary 2 and 3 students embark on learning
journeys to venues such as the Yakult Factory, HSA Blood Bank, Kok Fah
Farm, and Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum to appreciate how scientific
concepts are applied. Additionally, Nutrition and Food Science students
visit SunRice Academy to learn about the food industry, and take part in
pizza and dessert making. These experiences spark curiosity and demonstrate
fascinating applications of Science.</p>
<p>For Commonwealthians seeking deeper learning, we offer multiple pathways
for talent development. Our Lower Secondary Talent Development Programme
provides enhanced opportunities for motivated budding scientists to challenge
themselves, such as through participation in the National Chemistry and
Physics Olympiads. We also offer our STEM Elective Programme as a subject
for interested Upper Secondary students to pursue self-directed, innovative
research projects.</p>

<p>Our commitment to excellence is reflected in students' achievements. Our
Commonwealthians have obtained prestigious awards at national competitions
including the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, Singapore Youth Science
Festival, NJC Star Symposium, and A*STAR VJC Science Fair.</p>

<h3><strong>Where Science Meets Life</strong></h3>
<p>At Commonwealth Secondary School, we don't just teach scienceâ€”we live
it. Our programmes show students that research and innovation are essential
tools for understanding and improving the world around us. Through inquiry-based
learning and creative problem-solving, we prepare Commonwealthians to become
Confident Learners, Imaginative Trailblazers and Steward Leaders.</p>
