<h4>Campus</h4>
<p>Commonwealth Secondary School has transformed its campus into an ecologically
rich learning environment that aligns closely with national sustainability
goals such as the Singapore Green Plan 2030 and the #OneMillionTreesSG
movement. Guided by the vision of becoming a ‘School in Nature’, where
the natural environment serves as an eco-classroom for immersive, interdisciplinary
learning.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the school has established unique eco-spaces for
students to observe nature in school.</p>

<p>These eco-spaces have become dynamic outdoor classrooms that enhance learning
across disciplines, offering students authentic opportunities to explore
biodiversity, observe wildlife up close, study ecosystems in action, and
witness natural phenomena such as flash floods. Regular encounters with
nature not only enrich their academic experiences but also cultivate a
deep sense of curiosity, care, and respect for the environment.</p>
<p>The school’s commitment to sustainability is also reflected in its green
infrastructure and student-led initiatives. With 1,744 solar panels meeting
95% of its annual energy needs, the campus exemplifies the school’s initiative
in clean energy adoption. At the plant nursery, students take an active
role in reforestation by germinating and nurturing native tree saplings,
strengthening their identity as environmental stewards by contributing
to ecological restoration efforts. <strong>[Insert Photo]</strong>
