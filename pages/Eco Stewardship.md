# Eco-Stewardship

Commonwealth Secondary School was a West Zone Centre of Excellence for Environmental Education since 2008. The school was also the first school to be awarded the President’s Award for the Environment in 2009 and later awarded the ASEAN Eco-Schools Award (Secondary School Category) in 2012. In 2021, the school was selected by the Ministry of Education as one of four schools to pilot the Eco Stewardship Programme.

“A community of passionate learners who spark imagination, illuminate new frontiers, and inspire change for a better world.”

Anchored on four interconnected pillars: Campus, Curriculum, Culture, and Community, Commonwealth Secondary School’s holistic approach to sustainability education helps students to learn about environmental issues and also form a deep, personal connection with the natural world.

Leveraging our vibrant green spaces as living classrooms, the school provides immersive learning experiences that foster meaningful interactions with nature. These experiences lay the foundation for a strong sense of care, responsibility, and environmental consciousness. By embedding sustainability into every aspect of school life, we nurture our students as steward leaders—individuals who take ownership, inspire those around them, and lead purposeful efforts to protect and sustain the environment for future generations.
