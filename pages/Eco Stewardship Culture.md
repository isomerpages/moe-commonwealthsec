<h4><strong>Culture</strong></h4>
<p>At Commonwealth Secondary School, sustainability is not just a subject,
it is a way of life deeply embedded in our school culture. Through daily
practices and shared habits, we cultivate a strong sense of environmental
responsibility among staff and students.</p>
<p>By promoting sustainable behaviours such as reducing single-use plastics
and encouraging responsible consumption, the school successfully eliminated
bottled water sales and encouraged the use of reusable water bottles. Food
waste is also managed through the use of food digesters, student-led composting
efforts, and active collaboration with canteen vendors.</p>

<p>The ecological landscape of our school has transformed the campus into
a thriving sanctuary for local wildlife. As wildlife encounters become
a regular part of school life, they have fostered a culture of calm and
respectful coexistence with nature. These shared experiences deepen students’
and staff’s appreciation for biodiversity and are supported by clear protocols
that reflect the school’s values of care, empathy, and environmental stewardship—reinforcing
our ongoing commitment to living in harmony with the natural world.</p>
