<h3><strong>Curriculum</strong></h3>
<p>Sustainability is deeply embedded in the school’s total curriculum, spanning
both academic and co-curricular domains. Environmental education is intentionally
designed to move students beyond awareness toward meaningful engagement
and action.</p>
<p>In the academic curriculum, students carry out fieldwork in the school’s
eco-habitats, such as conducting water quality tests in the stream and
wetland for Geography investigations. In Science, they participate in the
Farm-to-Table Programme to explore sustainable farming practices and deepen
their understanding of food resilience. In the Craft and Technology curriculum,
students design eco-friendly innovations, such as hydroponic systems for
urban farming.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, students are empowered through their Co-Curricular
Activities (CCAs) to lead sustainability-driven initiatives. They are encouraged
to collaborate with community partners and champion causes they care about,
from responsible consumption to animal welfare, developing both leadership
and a strong sense of environmental stewardship in the process. <strong>[Insert Photo]</strong>
