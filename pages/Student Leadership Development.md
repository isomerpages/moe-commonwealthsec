<p>At Commonwealth Secondary School, our vision is for every Commonwealthian
to grow into a Steward Leader: a changemaker who champions a better future
with the community. It is built on the belief that every student can grow
in leadership through opportunities to learn and lead, whether in class,
school, CCA, or beyond. We believe that leadership development must be
intentional. We aim for our students to deeply explore, and adopt for themselves,
the concepts of stewardship, which include:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sense of Ownership:
Taking responsibility and initiative to make positive difference.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding Interdependence:
Recognizing our interconnectedness with others and the importance of working
together.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being Creatively Resilient:
Cultivating creativity and resilience in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a Long-Term View:
Fostering the ability to think and plan for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ultimately, we aspire for our students to become stewards of our
community and shared future, with each generation striving to pass on an
even better world to the next.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><u>Student Leadership Framework</u></strong></h3>
<p>At Commonwealth, our student leadership development is guided by the <strong>4E1R Model</strong>,
which charts a progressive pathway to nurture Commonwealthians to be Steward
Leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support this progression, we adopt <strong>level-specific foci</strong> for
each secondary level, anchored in key behavioural traits:</p>

<p>Our leadership development is intentionally structured to provide progressively
deeper experiences in alignment with students’ growth.</p>
<p>All Commonwealthians begin with foundational exposure to steward leadership
concepts through baseline lessons and school-wide experiences. These include
platforms such as Design Thinking, Level Camps, and Values-in-Action (VIA)
projects, which allow students to practise leadership in authentic contexts.
Throughout their years with us, students are also given opportunities to
take up leadership roles in their project groups, class discussions, or
as subject representatives and Class Committee members. Passionate students
are further encouraged and supported to step forward and lead in school-wide
leadership appointments such as Student Councillors, CCA Leaders, and Chairpersons
of school events.</p>
<p>As Commonwealthians take on these specific roles, they are mentored and
given opportunities to lead Class or CCA initiatives such as CCE Lessons,
Safer Internet Week, and student-initiated care and well-being activities.
These experiences provide opportunities to collaborate with peers, practise
leadership in real-world settings, and develop a stronger sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Commonwealthians in executive leadership roles, such as CCA EXCOs or Student
Council EXCO members, are further stretched through complex and meaningful
assignments. They take the lead in organising major school programmes such
as Teachers’ Day, Sec 1 Orientation Camp, Eclat, and other advocacy or
community-based initiatives. These experiences deepen students’ leadership
capacity and broaden their impact across the school and wider community.</p>
<p>Through this structured and progressive approach, grounded in the 4E1R
Model, we hope to develop every Commonwealthian to be a Steward Leader—a
changemaker who champions a better future with the community.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Student Council</u></strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Student Council is a dynamic, student-led organisation dedicated to
representing and serving the student body. Its mission is to build the
Commonwealthian spirit through engaging and enriching programmes, foster
a nurturing and supportive school environment, and maintain a safe and
positive learning atmosphere for all students.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Student Councillors are equipped through a combination of leadership training
and on-the-job experiences that prepare them to serve confidently and effectively.
They contribute across three interconnected wings: <strong>Peer Support Leaders</strong> who
mentor and support their peers and organise orientation activities; the <strong>Student Union</strong> which
champions school spirit and leads student-driven initiatives to strengthen
school culture; and the<strong> Prefectorial Board</strong> whose members
exemplify the school’s values by upholding discipline and leading school-wide
projects that promote wellbeing.</p>
<p>Together, these wings collaborate to create a vibrant, caring, and safe
school community.</p>

<h3><u>CCA Leaders</u></h3>
<p>CCA Leaders play a vital role in shaping the culture and spirit of their
co-curricular groups. They work closely with CCA teachers and instructors
to plan training sessions, organise events, and uphold the values and standards
of their activities. Their leadership motivates and guides their peers,
fostering teamwork, discipline, and a strong sense of commitment. CCA Leaders
help to create an inclusive and supportive environment where all members
can develop their skills, build resilience, and take pride in their group’s
achievements. They receive training and mentorship to equip them with the
skills needed to lead effectively and confidently.</p>
<h3><u>Class Committee</u></h3>
<p>The Class Committee plays a key role in fostering a positive and inclusive
classroom environment. Comprising the Class Chairpersons and Wellness Champions,
the committee works closely with form teachers to support class cohesion,
student well-being, and peer engagement. Class Chairpersons coordinate
class activities, facilitate communication, and represent the class in
school-wide matters. Wellness Champions focus on building peer relationships
and promoting emotional wellness through initiatives that encourage care,
empathy, and respect. Class Committee members undergo specialised training
and receive ongoing mentorship from the Student Council and their Class
Mentors to develop their leadership skills and confidence. Together, they
foster a sense of ownership and belonging within the class, helping to
make it a space where everyone feels included and supported.</p>
