Ethos/Philosophy
================

Commonwealth Secondary School believes in anchoring every child in our WEALTH values: Warmth, Enterprise, Adventurousness, Loyalty, Tenacity, Honour. 

We seek to have every student become a Confident Learner, Steward Leader and Imaginative Trailblazer. 

We nurture Confident Learners to have a Growth Mindset. We encourage students to try new challenges, be tenacious in the face of adversity, and to continually seek improvement for the future.

We seek for all students to become a Steward Leader. Our hope is for our students to contribute to our community, our nation, and our world and that each generation will create an even better future for the next generation.

We develop Imaginative Trailblazers through our instructional programme, our school-wide Design Thinking programme, and our Trailblazer programme. We enable our students to imagine, discover, express, and accomplish, so that they are inspired to create solutions for a better future.

We believe that every child is unique and possesses different interests and talents. Every child will be nurtured by a Champion Mentor, from admission to graduation, to grow and develop strengths in the areas they are passionate in.
