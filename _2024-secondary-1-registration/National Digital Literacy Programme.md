<h4>6. National Digital Literacy Programme</h4><p>The National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) was launched in March 2020 to help students strengthen their digital literacy. Under the NDLP, all Secondary school students will own a personal learning device (PLD) to support their learning. Singaporean students can use their Edusave Account to pay for a PLD selected by the school. Additional support will also be provided for students on MOE's Financial Assistance Scheme.</p><p>More information on the NDLP and the PLD will be shared at the Orientation Session for Parents of Secondary 1 students on 6 January 2024.</p>
