Values in Action
================

The Commonwealth Secondary School Values in Action (VIA) programme is aligned to the Servant Leadership qualities set out in our Character Curriculum. &nbsp;The programme aims to have all students attain a minimum of Level 4 for the Service criterion in the new LEAPs 2.0 system.

The VIA programme provides age-appropriate programmes at each level to progressively develop students to be concerned citizens and active contributors. The programme also provides students with the opportunity to exercise Design Thinking, the school’s innovation protocol, to address the needs of users in the school or the broader community. For example, Secondary Three students lead their CCAs in using the design thinking process to address challenges faced by the school’s long-term VWO partners and Secondary One using the design thinking process to understand the needs of the school cleaners in the iClean Project..

Beside level-specific platforms, the programme also provides opportunities for whole-school VIA projects. For example, all students participate in the annual hamper making event where students across all levels pack food items into hampers for distribution to Ayer Rajah Community Club.
