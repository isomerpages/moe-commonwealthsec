Values in Action
================

The Commonwealth Secondary School Values in Action (VIA) programme is aligned with the Steward Leadership Framework. It aims to cultivate a generation of students characterized by responsibility, ethical leadership, and a strong commitment to community service. The programme also supports all students attain a minimum of Level 4 for the Service criterion in the LEAPs 2.0 system.

The VIA program at Commonwealth Secondary School is designed to offer age-appropriate initiatives at each level. It progressively develops students into responsible citizens and active contributors to society. A central focus of the program is the incorporation of the Design Thinking innovation protocol, which aims to nurture students to be innovators and problem solvers. For instance, Secondary Three students take on a leadership role within their Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and apply the Design Thinking process to address challenges aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). This not only emphasizes the practical application of innovation but also instills a sense of global awareness and responsibility in students as they actively contribute to addressing pressing global challenges.

Beside level-specific platforms, the programme also provides opportunities for whole-school VIA projects. For example, all students participate in the annual gift bag making event where students across all levels pack celebratory items into gift bags to share joy with our Teban and Pandan Gardens residents.
