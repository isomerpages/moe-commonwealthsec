<h1>Values in Action</h1>
<p>The Commonwealth Secondary School Values in Action (VIA) programme is
aligned with the Steward Leadership Framework. It aims to cultivate a generation
of students characterized by responsibility, ethical leadership, and a
strong commitment to community service. The programme also supports all
students attain a minimum of Level 4 for the Service criterion in the LEAPs
2.0 system.</p>
<p>The VIA program at Commonwealth Secondary School is designed to offer
age-appropriate initiatives at each level. It progressively develops students
into responsible citizens and active contributors to society. A central
focus of the program is the incorporation of the Design Thinking innovation
protocol, which aims to nurture students to be innovators and problem solvers.
For instance, Secondary Three students take on a leadership role within
their Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and apply the Design Thinking process
to address challenges aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals (UNSDGs). This not only emphasizes the practical application of innovation
but also instills a sense of global awareness and responsibility in students
as they actively contribute to addressing pressing global challenges.</p>
<p>Beside level-specific platforms, the programme also provides opportunities
for whole-school VIA projects. For example, all students participate in
the annual gift bag making event where students across all levels pack
celebratory items into gift bags to share joy with our Teban and Pandan
Gardens residents.</p>
