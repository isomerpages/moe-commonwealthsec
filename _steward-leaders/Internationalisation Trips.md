# Internationalisation Trips 

In Commonwealth Secondary School, we believe that it is important to learn beyond the classroom. Our internationalisation trips create authentic learning environments which provide opportunities for Commonwealthians to learn and interact with people of different cultures. Through these trips, we hope that Commonwealthians will grow in the WEALTH values as well as humanistic, cultural and ethical values such as peace, friendship and collaboration.
