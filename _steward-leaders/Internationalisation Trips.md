# Internationalisation Trips 

In Commonwealth Secondary School, we believe that it is important to learn beyond the classroom. Our internationalisation trips create authentic learning environments which provide opportunities for Commonwealthians to learn and interact with people of different cultures. Through these trips, we hope that Commonwealthians will grow in the WEALTH values as well as humanistic, cultural and ethical values such as peace, friendship and collaboration.

Furthermore, learning by doing through field trips and school exchanges provides students with opportunities to immerse themselves in a foreign culture. It also gives them a chance to expand their understanding of global affairs. This helps Commonwealthians to become develop self-confidence, independence, greater self-esteem, and greater trust in their skills and abilities.  Commonwealthians will learn about the language, food, customs of the country they visit. They will also learn how to build relationships and find common ground with people who are different. In todayâ€™s globally connected world, these are essential skills which a confident learner must possess.
No matter what the future holds for them, we are confident that the experience of travelling and interacting with people around the world will provide Commonwealthians with invaluable lessons that they will carry with them for life.
