Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
=============================================
CCE is integrated into our instructional programmes, various co-curricular programmes and key Student Development Experiences (SDEs). The design and delivery of CCE lessons and programmes in CWSS are guided by the school’s Character Framework, anchored on  Steward Leadership. The 4 qualities of Steward Leadership are mapped to the CCE Learning Outcomes and CWSS WEALTH Values.

The school adopts the following guiding principles and approaches:

* Every teacher a CCE teacher

Teachers are best placed to lead and uphold the school’s WEALTH Values. Teachers role-model values to shape and instil good character in students. The quality of teacher-student relationships and the provision of a caring and enabling environment are essential to the character development of the students.

* Values are both taught and caught

Values are taught as knowledge and skills encapsulated in the CCE learning outcomes. Values are caught when students witness values enacted by peers and adults in different learning experiences.

* Life experiences as a context for learning

The teaching and learning of CCE focus on using students’ as well as teachers’ life experiences to form the context for learning. This enables students to better retain the knowledge, skills and values taught and caught.

* Expanding domain from self to world

Students learn to embrace their social roles through interaction with the world around them and act with consideration for the consequences of their actions on themselves and others.



The school’s key CCE programmes include:-

*   _Values-In-Action_, which is an important aspect of CCE in developing vital 21st century skills and social-emotional competencies. CWSS works closely with our long-term beneficiaries to provide opportunities for students to give back to the community.

  

*   *Education and Career Guidance* , (ECG) experiences helps students to develop a sense of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and resilience to tackle challenges, embrace opportunities and appreciate the value of various occupations.

  
*   _Cohort Camps_, provide students with immersive and experiential learning opportunities to develop character traits of resilience and resourcefulness, as well as social skills such as collaboration and communication. Each cohort will go through different theme and experiences during their camp.
