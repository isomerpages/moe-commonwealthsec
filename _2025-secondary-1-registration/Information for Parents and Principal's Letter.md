<h4>1. Information for Parents</h4>
<p>Congratulations on your childâ€™s successful posting to Commonwealth Secondary
School!</p>
<p>Please note that your child need not physically report to the school on
posting day to confirm their posting. The school will instead be using
Parents Gateway (PG) to communicate with parents (on the afternoon) after
the Secondary 1 Posting Results are released.</p>
